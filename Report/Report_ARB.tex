\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
%It should be written as much as possible in non-technical terms, so that a
%lay reader can understand the context and the contribution of the paper.

Springs have many everyday uses, such as in cars, homes, gyms, and industry. For example, springs are used in acceleration switches like the one seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Acceleration_Switch}. Their purpose in this instance is to close an electrical circuit once the object carrying the switch reaches a certain acceleration. This mechanism provides power to sensory equipment and data recorders for very precise amounts of time, and an application of its use is to collect data from rocket sled experiments. 

		\begin{figure}[h]
		 \begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=.2]{Acceleration_Switch.png}\end{center}
		 \caption{An example of an acceleration switch, see reference \cite{Massad2015}.}
		 \label{fig:Acceleration_Switch}
		 
		 \end{figure}	 
		
These rocket sled tests include very high velocities and accelerations and end in a destructive impact. Since the test is not easily replicated, we must have the ability to consistently and correctly collect data. This means we require that the spring in the acceleration switch must behave as expected to the forces exerted on it, and having a switch that is closed earlier or later than expected is undesirable~\cite{IMSM2010}. Designing a spring to behave as desired is a complicated problem that requires satisfying numerous constraints on the spring's physical properties. That the desired spring can vary depending on the application further complicates the problem. 

Spring design under these conditions amounts to a constrained optimization problem where certain properties of the spring may need to be maximized or minimized subject to bounds on some or all of the spring's other properties. Extending the scope of focus beyond springs' use in acceleration switches, which already cover a vast spread of specific spring designs, results in even more possibilities for design specifications. Rather than developing methods to solve these problems on an ad hoc basis, developing a tool to address a wide variety of constrained optimization problems for spring design would be beneficial. 

Designing an optimal spring is not a new problem. Brake et al. considered the design of an acceleration switch with enabled uncertainty~\cite{IMSM2010}. Alternatively, Sastry et al. implemented probabilistic response surface methodology to investigate the complications of uncertainty in designing a spring~\cite{Reliability}. Others have considered the reduction of the optimization problem to focus on a single parameter~\cite{Robust}. Similar tools to the ones mentioned above also exist~\cite{Paredes}.

Motivated by a workflow premise, we produce a novel tool with new capabilities. The novelties we include are the inherit flexibility in our tool's framework, tools to visualize the existence of solutions for constrained optimization problems, sensitivity analysis capabilities, and design optimization under uncertainty. We also discuss the inclusion of stress relaxation constraints in the spring design, which to our knowledge has not been considered before. We provide details regarding these items as follows. Section~\ref{sec:The_Problem} formally defines the spring design problem for helical compression springs. Section~\ref{sec:The_Approach} outlines the workflow. Section~\ref{sec:Computational_Experiments} shares cases studies using our approach, and Section~\ref{sec:Summary} summarizes our work and provides suggestions for future work.

			
\section{The Problem} 
\label{sec:The_Problem}

\subsection{Helical Compression Springs}
\label{sec:Springs}

Helical compression springs, such as the one in Figure~\ref{fig:Spring}, are possibly the most recognizable type of spring and are the spring of choice for this work. 

		\begin{figure}[h]
		 \begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=.2]{Spring.png}\end{center}
		 \caption{An example of a helical compression spring~\cite{Massad2015}.}
		 \label{fig:Spring}
		 
		 \end{figure}

We can uniquely define a helical compression spring by a set of design parameters, which then determine physical attributes of the spring~\cite{Massad2015}. Figure~\ref{fig:Descriptions} provides visual representations for a few of the basic parameters and a complete list of parameters and attributes follows.

		% Group parameters and change from enumerate
		\noindent \textbf{Spring Design Parameters:}
		\begin{description}[leftmargin=!,labelwidth=\widthof{\bfseries Ultimate torsional stress:}]
			\item [Inner Diameter] denoted $\mathbf{d_{i}}$, illustrated in figure \ref{Description2}.
			
			\item [Outer Diameter] denoted $\mathbf{d_{o}}$, illustrated in figure \ref{Description1}.
			
			\item [Wire Diameter] denoted $\mathbf{d_{w}}$.
			
			\item[Total Coils] denoted $\mathbf{N_{t}}$, this is the number to rotations of wire in the spring, we allow for partial rotations.
			
			\item[Active Coils] denoted $\mathbf{N_{a}}$, active coils are not touching any other coils. The number of active coils is subject to the spring being closed or open. Closed means that the end coils are welded, where as open means they are not. For this reason a spring must have at least 2 coils.

			\item[Free Length] denoted $\mathbf{L_{free}}$, the spring's length without any force applied. i.e., this is the spring length before being installed in the acceleration switch.
			
			\item[Solid Length] denoted $\mathbf{L_{solid}}$, the spring's length when all coils are compressed together.
			\item[Open Length] denoted $\mathbf{L_{open}}$, the spring's length at open position. i.e., for the acceleration switch this would be before the rocket sled test is started. 
			
			\item[Close Length] denoted $\mathbf{L_{close}}$, spring length at close position. i.e., this would be when enough force is applied for the acceleration switch to close and start collecting data.
			
			\item[Hard Length] denoted $\mathbf{L_{hard}}$, the maximum a spring can compress for the application. i.e., for the acceleration switch this is the maximum compression the acceleration switch's spring should be allowed. 
			
			\item[Open Force] denoted $\mathbf{F_{open}}$, this is the force on the spring in open position, i.e., the resting force for the acceleration switch.
					
			\item[Pitch] denoted $\mathbf{p}$ illustrated in figure \ref{Description1}, depends on the $\mathbf{d_{w}}$,$\mathbf{L_{free}}$, and $\mathbf{N_{a}}$.			
			
			\item[Shear Modulus] (or modulus of rigidity), denoted $\mathbf{G}$, is one of several quantities for measuring the stiffness of materials.
			
			\item[Young's Modulus] (or elastic modulus), denoted $\mathbf{E}$, is a measurement of force that is needed  to stretch (or compress) a sample of material.
			
			\item[Poisson Ratio] denoted $\mathbf{\nu}$, is a measurement of the poisson effect of a material. 
			
			\item[Ultimate Torsional Stress] denoted $\mathbf{UTS}$.

% Give context to statement		
One can see that the above parameters are physical design parameters. Each of these are subject to design tolerances. Below is a set of empirical attributes that within a range of values exhibit typical behavior for a spring. We will assume that these attributes are within that range. 


		\begin{center}\textbf{Spring Attributes:}\end{center}
			\begin{description}
				\item [Spring Rate (k):] \begin{equation} k = \frac{G}{8N_{a}}\frac{d_{w}^{4}}{(d_{i} + d_{w})^{3}}\end{equation}
				\end{description}
			The spring rate is a quantity used to measure the rigidity or stiffness of the object. 
			\begin{description}	
			\item[Spring Index (C):]\begin{equation}C = \frac{d_{i}}{d_{w}} + 1.\end{equation}
			\end{description}
				 The spring index gives a measurement of the inner diameter to the wire diameter. This is useful because outside of certain values the design will require more tolerance and cost also increases. \cite{SpringIndex}
			\begin{description}	
			\item[Coil Binding Gap:]\begin{equation} g = \frac{L_{hard} - L_{solid}(d_{w},N_{a}; ec)}{N_{t} - 1}\end{equation}
			\end{description}
				If the spring is allowed to go to solid compression, it is possible the spring could continue compression and cause coils to bind. Think about your favorite slinky. $L_{solid}$, is in terms of $d_{w}$, $N_{a}$, and end conditions (ec). Refer back to $N_{a}$ for what end conditions mean physically.
		

		\begin{description}
			 \item[Max Shear Stress:]\begin{equation} \frac{G(L_{free} - L_{hard})}{4 \pi N_{a} (ec)} \left[\frac{d_{w} (4d_{i}^{2} + 9.46d_{i} 
d_{w} + 3 d_{w}^{2})}{d_{i}(d_{i}+d_{w})^{3}}\right]< UTS\end{equation}
		\end{description}
				Shear stress is a measurement of stress coplanar to the spring, this puts a maximum we allow. 
			\begin{description}
			\item[Diametral Expansion($d_{expand}$):]\begin{equation} d_{expand} = d_{w} + \sqrt{(d_{i} + d_{w})^{2} + \frac{p^{2} - d_{w}}{\pi^{2}}}
			\end{equation}
			\end{description}
			This is the expansion of the diameter as compression of the spring is happening. One may notice that \begin{equation}p^{2} \ge d_{w} - \pi^{2} (d_{i} + d_{w})^{2},\end{equation} this is putting an implicit constraint on how much the spring can be extended/compressed.
			

Design an algorithm that optimizes springs with interchangeable objectives and constraints. In addition, attempt to incorporate properties stress relaxation and creep into the available objectives and constraints. 

A list of possible constraints/objectives given in minimization form is below, please note that \\$d_{i}^{max}, d_{o}^{max}, k_{max}, C_{max}$, and $g_{min}$ are user defined bounds. 
 % remove repetitions
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item $d_{i} < d_{i}^{max}$, this sets a design constraint on what we will allow the inner diamter to be. For the acceleration switch, we must have a spring that will fit the housing of the switch.
%	\item $d_{i} < d_{o}$, physically we must have a bigger outer diameter than inner diameter.
%	\item $d_{i} + 2d_{w} < d_{o}^{max}$, The outer diameter cannot exceed some design limitation.
%	\item$d_{expand} - d_{0}^{max} < 0 $, we will not allow the spring to expand more than a certain amount during compression.
%	\item$ \frac{G}{8N_{a}}\frac{d_{w}^{4}}{(d_{i} + d_{w})^{3}} - k_{max} \le 0 $, there is a maximum spring rate or stiffness that we will allow. 
%
%	\item $\frac{d_{i}}{d_{w}} + 1 - C_{max}< 0$, similarly we will only allow a maximum ratio between the inner diameter and wire diameter. 
%
%	\item $(L_{free} - L_{open})\frac{G}{8N_{a}}\frac{d_{w}^{4}}{(d_{i} + d_{w})^{3}} - F_{open} = 0 $, $F_{open}$ should be physically possible given its formulation.
%
%	\item $\frac{L_{hard} - L_{solid}}{N_{t} - 1} + g_{min} \le  0$. There is a minimum gap we wish to have to ensure our coils cannot bind. 
%
%	\item$\frac{L_{free}}{d_{i} + d_{w}} - \pi \sqrt{\frac{2(2 \nu + 1)}{\nu + 2}}$, if a spring is slender, it may buckle or fold on itself. This is a constraint to address this physical attribute. 
%
%	\item$-UTS + \frac{G(L_{free} - L_{hard})}{4 \pi N_{a} (ec)} \left[\frac{d_{w} (4d_{i}^{2} + 9.46d_{i} 
%d_{w} + 3 d_{w}^{2})}{d_{i}(d_{i}+d_{w})^{3}}\right] < 0$
%
%We do not wish to allow the torsional stress to exceed a certain amount, the ultimate torsional stress, $UTS$.
%
%\end{enumerate}	

This set of attributes and parameters define a spring's design and can all play a role in designing an optimal spring for a particular situation. The length of this list is what makes constructing a tool to handle a variety of 



This list is not exhaustive as we want a user to be able to define new constraints and objectives. The incorporation of stress relaxation and creep are two examples of this. If the reader wishes to read about these in detail please check out section \ref{sec:stress}. 

In addition to these we should be able to minimize any parameter of the spring. It may be possible they wish to minimize the wire diameter, or the length of the spring at a certain state.  

In order to simplify the problem we have some assumptions. First, we have assumed that constraints and objectives are all in terms of the number of total coils. This is to reduce the complexity of knowing if a constraint is dependent on the active number or total number of coils. These two numbers are dependent on the end conditions of the spring, whether it is open or closed at the end. 

For this reason we also will consider all springs to be have a closed end condition. With these assumptions we simplify our constraints for pitch, $p$, solid length, $L_{solid}$, and the diametral expansion, $d_{expand}$.


These assumptions have reduced the set of design parameters and have allowed us to simplify the problem. Without these assumptions we would need to deduce at run time what formulas we can use and this is a challenging problem from an implementation stand point. Also, we have a very complicated formula for diametral expansion if the end conditions are not closed. This presents issues of solving a cubic without the ability of discerning if the roots will be physically meaningful. 


\subsection{Constrained Optimization}
\label{sec:Constrained_Optimization}

Given an input of objectives and constraints on those objectives which are both defined by a set of design variables, we can formulate the challenge of designing an optimal spring as a constrained optimization problem. The general formulation of such a problem is 
				\begin{equation*}
 					\begin{aligned}
 						& \underset{\textbf{x}}{\text{min}}
 						& & F(\textbf{x}), \\
 						& \text{subject to}
 						& & G(\textbf{x}) \le 0.
 					\end{aligned}
				\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{x} is a set of variables for optimization, they are user specified.
	
	\item F(\textbf{x}) is the objective function. It is comprised of any parameters or attributes described above. It can also include other user defined attributes and parameters not considered in this paper. The user specifies the objective function.  
	
	\item G(\textbf{x}) is the list of constraints. It is comprised of any parameters or attributes described above. It can also include other user defined attributes and parameters not considered in this paper. The user specifies the constraints to use.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Approach}
\label{sec:The_Approach}



Our approach follow the workflow illustrated in Figure~\ref{Workflow}. This is an iterative process that receives a user specified problem, reformulates and solves the problem, and then returns a result for the user to accept or decline. The remainder of this section expands upon the details of each element in this diagram.

		\begin{figure}[h!]
		 \begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=.4]{IMSM_Workflow.png}\end{center}
		 \caption{Illustration of the flow of our approach.}
		 \label{Workflow}
		 
		 \end{figure}

\subsection{User Input}
\label{subsec:User_Input}

The first step in our work flow is receiving spring design specifications from a user interested in building a spring for use in some industrial application.  The application will typically involve a set of attributes (eg. spring rate) to optimize and some design constraints (eg. the spring's height or diameter).  For example, consider the acceleration switch discussed during the introduction.  In this case, the user would like to achieve the smallest possible spring rate and spring index, while satisfying the physical dimensions of the acceleration switch.

\subsection{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:Problem_Definition}

Once the user has provided their input, the next step is formulating the problem.  This requires specifying an optimization objective, design variables and constraints.  To reduce the size of the permissible problem space, the user must specify the optimization function as a weighted sum of minimums and maximums.  While there are other methods for multicriteria optimization, including these in our scheme has been left to future work.  Also, we have reduced the space of design variables based on discussions with engineers experienced with spring design.

After formulating the problem, a library of predefined constraints and objectives is called to initialize the optimization software.  In some problems, however, the designer may need to constrain or optimize an attribute that is not part of the existing library.  If the user has a mathematical formulation for the desired attribute, it can be added to the constraint library for use in the problem formulation.

Our team's integration of stress relaxation provides a useful example of this process.  In some design problems, relaxation is an important objective or constraint.  To our knowledge, however, there are no spring design processes which accounting for the effects of relaxation.  Thus, our team undertook a study of stress relaxation to find a mathematical formulation (see Appendix-xx for technical details) which was added to the function library and can now be used in any problem formulation.

To allow the user maximum flexibility in their problem formulation, our software uses an object oriented design.  Object-oriented programming is an approach to software design that centers around classes which are data containers capable of performing a predefined set of tasks.  For example, our program has a \textbf{Constraint} class that includes the constraint's function, and a way to check whether the constraint is violated at a given point.

Using classes allow flexibility because the program's algorithm are designed to operate on the classes.  For example, the \textbf{OptimizationProblem} class generates the input for the optimizer and sensitivity analysis.  When the user inputs a new problem, the program generates an \textbf{OptimizationProblem} with a specific optimization function and set of constraints.  Thus, once the user has a problem formulation, our software can convert their problem into the objects needed for the optimizer to run.

\subsection{Feasibility}
\label{subsec:Feasibility}

Once the user has set a problem, the next step is determining the nature of the feasible region.  To assess feasibility, we use a Latin hypercube sampling method, which is designed to ensure sampling coverage over the entire domain.  This approach is used because the user defined constraints are very general in nature (for example, they can be linear or non-linear).  If a feasible point cannot be identified, the algorithm terminates and informs the user that a feasible point cannot be found.  At this point, the user can try a more exhaustive search or reformulate the problem.

Additionally, a graphical tool has been added to help the user analyze the problem's feasible region and the value of the objective function over the region.  As illustrated in the case studies, a plot with two or three state variables can be displayed highlighting the problem's overall feasible region and the contributions from each individual constraint.  This will allow the user to identify the nature of the constraints in their problem.


\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{subsec:Sensitivity}
\hspace{5 mm} As the dimension of design variable space increases, the computational expense of the optimization procedure increases. To reduce the computational expense, it is often desirable to reduce the design variable space by removing the variables that have very little influence on the objective function. Thus, a dimension reduction strategy is required to reduce the design variable space. 

Dimension reduction approaches have been divided into two categories - (1)filter approach, and (2)wrapper approach. In the filter approach, the input variables are ranked according to a ranking criterion and the most dominant variables can be selected by assuming a threshold influence value. In the wrapper approach, a subset of variables is selected from the list of all possible subsets of the input variables that best estimate the output variable. Sensitivity analysis, a filter approach, is used in this work for dimension reduction. 

Two types of sensitivity analysis have been developed in the literature - local sensitivity analysis and global sensitivity analysis. The local sensitivity index of a variable measures the sensitivity of the model output when the variable is fixed at a single value whereas the global sensitivity (GSA) index measures the variation of model output when the variable is varied over its range. Therefore, GSA is used as it considers the entire range of a variable in computing the sensitivity to the output. Note that the input variables represent the design variables and model represents the objective function.
Consider a objective function, $G$, with $n$ design variables given by $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, ...  $x_{n}$, given by

\centerline{$Y = G(x_{1}, x_{2}, ... x_{n})$}

In GSA, two types of indices can be calculated for each variable - first order index and total effects index. The first-order index ($S_{i}^{I}$) quantifies the uncertainty contribution of an input variable, without considering its interactions with other variables, to the output variable uncertainty. Similarly, the total effects index ($S_{i}^{T}$) quantifies the uncertainty contribution of an input variable by considering its interactions with all variables, to the output uncertainty. The expressions for the two sensitivity indices are given below as 

\centerline{$S_{i}^{I} = \frac{V_{X_i}(E_{X_{-i}}(Y|X_{i}))}{V(Y)}$}
\centerline{$S_{i}^{T} = \frac{E_{X_{-i}}(V_{X_{i}}(Y|X_{-i}))}{V(Y)}$}

Given a design range (lower and upper bounds), a variable can be assumed to be uniformly distributed in the design range. For each variable, the first-order index is calculated and if it is less than an assumed threshold value, then that variable is assumed insensitive and removed from the optimization procedure. Thus, dimension reduction is implemented for a faster design optimization.\cite{Bioinformatics} \cite{Wrappers} \cite{Error} \cite{Global}


\subsection{Optimization}
\label{subsec:Optimization}
\hspace{5 mm} A general constrained design optimization problem can be formulated as follows

\centerline{$Min \hspace{2 mm} f(X)$}
such that

\centerline{$g(X) \leq 0$}
\centerline{$lb_{X} \leq X \leq ub_{X}$}

\noindent Several optimization algorithms (both local and global) are available to solve the above optimization problem. Two algorithms - BFGS (local) and DIRECT (global) have been tried for design optimization. The key differences between the two algorithms are described below. BFGS algorithm requires the gradient and Hessian of the objective function, and also an initial point for optimization whereas DIRECT does not require the objective function to be differentiable. Since DIRECT is a global algorithm, it does not require an initial point. A downside of DIRECT is that it requires more computations compared to BFGS. The 'fmincon' function in MATLAB, which implements the BFGS algorithm, requires the linear and non-linear constraints to be provided separately. Separation of linear and non-linear constraints is hard to implements in an automated software framework because they are problem-dependent whereas DIRECT does not require such segregation between constraints. Therefore, DIRECT global algorithm is used for optimization.

% new subsection

\hspace{5 mm} It is also essential to account for the variability in the manufacturing process(tolerance) in the design of springs. The tolerance for each of the spring parameters is assumed to be equal to one percent of the value of the variable. Thus, each variable follows a uniform distribution with unknown mean and known variance. The optimization formulation after accounting for tolerances can now be written as 

\centerline{$Min \hspace{2mm} \mu_{f} (X,d)$}

such that

\centerline{$Pr(g_{i}(X,d) \leq 0)\geq p_{t}^{i}$}
\centerline{$Pr(X \geq lb_{X})\geq p_{lb}$}
\centerline{$Pr(X \leq ub_{X})\geq p_{ub}$}
\centerline{$lb_{d} \leq d \leq ub_{d}$}

\noindent where $X,d$ represent the design variables with tolerances and non-design variables with tolerances respectively. The first constraint represents the probabilistic inequality constraint and the other constraints represent the bounds for the design variables. Optimization with tolerance is a nested double loop process where optimization is carried out in the outer loop (using DIRECT)and in each iteration of optimization, reliability analysis is carried out in the inner loop to check the probabilistic constraints. In this work, Monte Carlo simulations are used to carry out reliability analysis.

\section{Summary and Future Work}
\label{sec:Summary}
The ability to interchange constraints and objective functions with any number of design variables allows the user the utmost flexibility. With the addition of feasibility and sensitivity analysis it is possible for any configuration of objective function, constraints, and design variables to be analyzed for refinement. The quantification of stress relaxation and creep allow the user a chance to incorporate these properties into any configuration, especially those that have never been tested. 

Some limitations of the approach outlined are as follows. The choice of optimization and sensitivity analysis are fixed, however, they are modularized to allow a different optimization routine and sensitivity analysis to be ported in. Given the amount of flexibility that is enabled, a user will have to be able to decide if a infeasible solution is due to user error. 

Future work is bountiful for this approach. More analysis of the stress relaxation and creep could result in better performance. An in depth analysis of different models of stress relaxation and their performance in our model would be beneficial. The flexibility allows the inclusion of many different models of stress relaxation and creep to be added

This work developed an intelligent tool for the design of helical compression springs. The key highlights of this tool are (1) Allows for flexible optimization, which enables design of springs with interchanging objective functions and constraints, (2)Can incorporate stress relaxation in the design process, (3) Provides a feasibility design space given the constraints, (4)Provide the global sensitivity indices of the design variables to the objective function. The ability to interchange constraints and objective functions with any number of design variables allows the user the utmost flexibility. With the addition of feasibility and sensitivity analysis it is possible for any configuration of objective function, constraints, and design variables to be analyzed for refinement. The quantification of stress relaxation and creep allow the user a chance to incorporate these properties into any configuration, especially those that have never been tested. The sensitivity indices serves two purposes - help the designer understand which variables have the most influence on the objective function and also help in dimension reduction in the design space for a faster optimization.

Some limitations of the approach outlined are as follows. The choice of optimization and sensitivity analysis are fixed, however, they are modularized to allow a different optimization routine and sensitivity analysis to be ported in. Given the amount of flexibility that is enabled, a user will have to be able to decide if a infeasible solution is due to user error.

%A couple of sentences of stress relaxation

In this work, the DIRECT algorithm for global optimization is used for the design of springs. Also, computational experiments have been carried to perform design optimization considering tolerances in design variables but not incorporated in the design tool; this is an future work of importance. 

More analysis of the stress relaxation and creep could result in better performance. An in depth analysis of different models of stress relaxation and their performance in our model would be beneficial. The flexibility allows the inclusion of many different models of stress relaxation and creep to be added. In this work, the nested double-loop approach is used for global sensitivity analysis. As the dimension of design variables increases, the nested double-loop approach becomes computationally very intensive. Therefore, more faster single-loop techniques should be considered. Also, reliability analysis within the optimization procedure is carried out using Monte Carlo sampling. As the complexity of the problem increases, in terms of the number of design variables and the number of constraints, Monte Carlo sampling becomes very intensive. Therefore, faster analytical and sampling techniques such as First Order Reliability Methods (FORM), Importance sampling need to be considered.

\subsection{Basics about creep and stress relaxation}
\label{sec:stress}
A rocket mounted spring is expected to deliver normal mechanical output under extreme temperatures. The analysis of creep behavior helps us design a spring to meet the requirements under rough conditions.

Creep is the strain increase under constant stress, usually activated by high temperatures. Three mechanisms have been proposed to account for the phenomenon: dislocation slip and climb, grain boundary sliding and diffusional flow. We focus on the creep caused by the dislocation mechanism. The material's creep tendency is determined by a creep test. During a test, the spring is kept at $0.3-0.5T_m$ ($T_m$ is the melting temperature of the material) and loaded by a constant tensile force.

Conventionally, creep can be divded into $3$ stages. In the first stage (primary/ reduced/trasient) ,the creep strain rate decreases to a certain value(minimum creep rate). The second stage(secondary/steady/stationary creep) is characterized by a nearly constant creep rate(minimum creep rate). In the third stage(tertiary creep), the creep strain rates increases rapidly and leads to rupture. The first stage is usually reversible with time after unloading, while the second/third ones are not. Since the primary creep occurs in a short duration and the tertiary one leads quickly to rupture, the secondary creep is under most serious consideration in many engineering designs.

Another common test to determine the material's susceptibility to high temperature is called stress relaxation. During the test the load is continuously decreased in such a way that the initial strain remains constant. The mechanism is more or less the same as that of creep.

\subsection{Creep rate law of material}
\label{sec:Creep}
The starting point is the assumption that the creep rate may be described as a product of three separate functions of stress, temperature and time
\[
\epsilon_{cr}(\sigma,T,t)=f_\sigma (\sigma) f_T(T) f_t(t)
\]
The widely used functions of stress $f_\sigma(\sigma)$ are (\cite{NaKo2006}):

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$a\sigma^n$ & Norton, 1929, Bailey, 1929 \\
$b\left( \exp{\sigma\over \sigma_0} -1 \right)$ & Soderberg, 1936 \\
$a\mathop{sinh}{\sigma\over \sigma_0}$ & Prandtl, 1928, Nadai, 1938, McVetty, 1943\\
$a_1\sigma^{n_1} + a_2 \sigma^{n_2}$ & Johnson et al., 1963 \\
$a\mathop{sinh} \left( {\sigma\over \sigma_0}\right)^n$ & Garofalo, 1965
\end{tabular}

where $a,b,a_1,a_2,\sigma_0,n_1,n_2$ are material constant. The dependence on the temperature $f_T(T)$ is usually expressed by the Arrhenius law
\[
f_T(T) = \exp \left( {-Q\over RT}\right)
\]
where $Q$ and $R$ denote the activation energy and the Boltzmann's constant.

The time dependence part $f_t(t)$ is assumed to be (\cite{Ch2000}):

\begin{tabular}{ll}
$t$ & secondary creep \\
$bt^m$ & Bailey \\
$(1+bt^{1/3})\exp{kt}$ & Andrade\\
$\sum_j a_j t^{m_j}$ & Graham and Walles
\end{tabular}

For simplicity, we are going to only use the Norton-Bailey law and ignore any dependence on the temperature since the temperature is constant.
\section{Stress relaxation of helical spring}
The following section is based on the paper(\cite{SiAt1970}). Due to conservation of the total shear strain, the sum of the creep strain $\epsilon_{cr}$'s rate of change and that of elastic shear strain $\epsilon_{el}$ is zero:
\[
\dot{\epsilon}_{cr} + \dot{\epsilon}_{el} = 0
\]
Dot is meant as differentiation in time. The elastic shear strain is related to the shear stress by shear modulus $G$: $\epsilon_{el} = \sigma/G$ and taking the derivative with time on both sides, we arrive at
\[
\dot{\epsilon}_{el} = \dot{\sigma}/G
\]
According to Norton-Bailey law(also known as time hardening law),
\begin{equation} \label{eq:N-B}
\dot{\epsilon}_{cr}(t)=c\sigma^{n+1} t^{k-1}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the shear strain rate, $n,k$ are temperature dependent material constants.

Substituting the above two equations to the conservation law,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:diff}
\dot{\sigma}(t)/G+c\sigma(t)^{n+1} t^{k-1}=0
\end{equation}
The initial condition is
\[
\sigma (0) = G\theta r
\]
where $\theta$ is the initial twist angle per unit length, $r$ the radius of wire.

\[
\sigma = \left( (G\theta r)^{-n} + {c\over k} Gnt^k \right)^{-{1\over n}}
\]

The torque can be written as
\begin{align*}
&M(t) = 2\pi \int_0^{d_w} r^2 \sigma(r,t)\,\mathrm{d} r\\
&M(0)={1\over 2} G\pi\theta d_w^4
\end{align*}
where $d_w$ is the wire diameter.

Since the spring load is linearly related the torque $P_z(t)\propto M(t)$, given the constant deflection $s$,
\[
{P_z(t)\over P_z(0)} = {M(t)\over M(0)} = {4\over G\theta d_w^4}\int_0^{d_w} r^2 \left( (G\theta r)^{-n} + {c\over k} Gnt^k \right)^{-{1\over n}} \,\mathrm{d} r
\]
where
\[
\theta = {2s\over \pi N_a ((d_i+d_o)/2)^2}
\]
The integral has no endpoint singularity and can be integrated to high order precision using the Gauss quadrature formula. The closer this quantity is to $1$, the better the spring quality is. We notice that a seemingly simpler form has been presented in the paper.
\[
{}_{2}F_1 \left( {4\over n},{1\over n};{4+n\over n};{c\theta^n G^{n+1} n t^k\over k} {d_w^n\over 2^n}\right)
\]
which we find to yield unrealistic values due to divergence issues.

\subsection{Stress relaxation of helical spring}
\label{sec:Relaxation}

Due to conservation of the total shear strain, the sum of the creep strain $\epsilon^{cr}$'s rate of change and that of elastic shear strain $\epsilon_{el}$ is zero:
\[
\dot{\epsilon}_{cr} + \dot{\epsilon}_{el} = 0
\]
The elastic shear strain is related to the shear stress by shear modulus $G$:
\[
\epsilon_{el} = \sigma/G
\]
and therefore
\[
\dot{\epsilon}_{el} = \dot{\sigma}/G
\]
According to Norton-Bailey law(also known as time hardening law),
\begin{equation} \label{eq:N-B}
\dot{\epsilon}_{cr}(t)=c\sigma^{n+1} t^{k-1}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the shear strain rate, $n,k$ are temperature dependent material constants.

Substituting the above two equations to the conservation law,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:diff}
\dot{\sigma}(t)/G+c\sigma(t)^{n+1} t^{k-1}=0
\end{equation}
The initial condition is
\[
\sigma (0) = G\theta r
\]
where $\theta$ is the initial twist angle per unit length, $r$ the radius of wire.

\[
\sigma = \left( (G\theta r)^{-n} + {c\over k} Gnt^k \right)^{-{1\over n}}
\]

The torque can be written as
\[
M(t) = 2\pi \int_0^{d_w} r^2 \sigma(r,t)\,\mathrm{d} r ={}_{2}F_1 \left( {4\over n},{1\over n};{4+n\over n};{c\theta^n G^{n+1} n t^k\over k} {d_w^n\over 2^n}\right) M(0)
\]
where $d_w$ is the wire diameter.

Since the spring load is linearly related the torque $P_z(t)\propto M(t)$, given the constant deflection $s$,
\[
{P_z(t)\over P_z(0)} = {}_{2}F_1 \left( {4\over n},{1\over n};{4+n\over n};{c\theta^n G^{n+1} n t^k\over k} {d_w^n\over 2^n}\right)
\]
where
\[
\theta = {2s\over \pi N_a ((d_i+d_o)/2)^2}
\]
The closer this quantity is to $1$, the better the spring quality is.

\subsection{Creep of helical spring}
This section is based on the paper(\cite{Ko2014}). The starting point is still the Norton-Bailey law (\ref{eq:N-B}). There is naturally another way to write the shear strain rate:
\[
\dot{\epsilon}_{cr} = \dot{\theta} r = {8\dot{s} r\over \pi N_a (d_i+d_o)^2}
\]
We obtain $\sigma$ from substiting the above equation into Norton-Bailey law. Given the constant spring force $P_z^0$,
\[
P_z^0{d_i+d_o\over 4}=M(0)=2\pi\int_0^{d_w} r^2 \sigma(r,t)\,\mathrm{d} r
={\pi\over 4}{n+1\over 4+3n}\left( {8d_w^{4+3n}\dot{s} \over t^{k-1} (d_i+d_o)^2 \pi N_a c (d_i+d_o)^2} \right)^{{1\over n+1}}
\]
It can be deduced that the spring length $s$ follows
\[
s(t) = s(0) + \left( {(d_i+d_o)P_z^0\over \pi}{4+3n\over n+1} \right)^{n+1} {\pi (d_i+d_o)^2 N_a c\over 8kd_w^{4+3n}} t^k
\]
where $s(0)$ is the initial spring length. The less the difference of the spring length $s(t)-s(0)$, the better the spring quality is.
