This file is for keeping notes and documentation on everything related to our project.

Project Demands:
- Flexible code to handle a variety of optimization problems with respect to spring properties
- Tools to analyze user-provided problems
- Novel inclusion of relaxation physics to allow for their inclusion in user-provided problems
- Account for manufacturing tolerances when optimizing spring design
- Code needs to be designed to include the possibility of interfacing with a GUI

Addressing the Demands:
- Flexibility of the code is addressed using an OOP approach
- Analysis tools to include sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices, interaction webs, and graphical tools
- Relaxation model is taken from reference 14 in the report
- introduction to design under uncertainty tested but not included in the framework
- OOP also lends itself to the construction of a GUI
