This file is for keeping notes and documentation on everything related to our project.

Project Demands:
- Flexible code to handle a variety of optimization problems with respect to spring properties
- Tools to analyze user-provided problems
- Novel inclusion of relaxation physics to allow for their inclusion in user-provided problems
- Code needs to be designed to include the possibility of interfacing with a GUI

Addressing the Demands:
- Flexibility of the code is addressed using an OOP approach
- Analysis tools to include sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices, interaction webs, and graphical tools
- Relaxation model is taken from Spring-relaxation-2014-02
- OOP also lends itself to the construction of a GUI

To-Do:
- Include check for the existence of a feasible solution before optimization/sensitivity
- Run various case studies and corresponding analysis
- Organize results for presentation purposes
- Formally include and use relaxation
